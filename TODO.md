# Agent service migration TODO

This tracks logic and behavior gaps in `packages/agent-core/src/services/agent`
against the current implementation under `packages/agent-core/src/agent`.

## PromptService / input flow

- [x] Implement `undo(count)` in `PromptService`.
- [x] Implement `clear()` in `PromptService`.
- [x] Make active-turn `steer()` enter at a step boundary instead of waiting for the whole turn to finish.
- [x] Replace plain active-turn errors with `KimiError(ErrorCodes.TURN_AGENT_BUSY)`.
- [x] Keep `retry()` origin-free for now; no current service logic consumes retry origin.
- [x] Add replay/resume handling for `turn.launch` events if the service layer takes over wire replay.
- [x] Add user prompt hook behavior if hooks remain outside `TurnRunner`.

## ContextMemory

- [x] Own the `context.splice` wire record declaration and replay application.
- [x] Keep `context.splice` as the single context mutation primitive; do not add separate append-message records.
- [x] Prevent external mutation of the returned history.
- [x] Apply restored `context.splice` records without appending duplicate records.

## Loop Transcript Assembly

- [x] Handle loop events: `step.begin`, streamed content, tool calls, tool results, and `step.end`.
- [x] Insert loop-generated assistant and tool messages into context without requiring context history to be ordered.
- [x] Add resume handling for interrupted tool calls.
- [x] Add matched-tail message removal for stop-hook cleanup in the service that owns that cleanup.

## ContextProjector

- [x] Preserve well-formed projected tool exchanges when context history is out of order.

## Context Usage Accounting

- [x] Track context token count and token count with pending messages.
- [x] Feed context token status into compaction/status reporting.

## TurnRunner

- [x] Allow `afterStep` hooks to request continuation of the current turn.
- [x] Continue automatically after tool results so the model can observe tool output.
- [x] Use monotonic numeric turn ids.
- [x] Restore the turn id counter from replayed `turn.launch` records.
- [x] Emit protocol turn lifecycle events and clear the active turn with current RPC timing.
- [x] Bridge loop step lifecycle events to protocol events.
- [x] Bridge loop retry/interruption events to protocol events.
- [x] Bridge loop streaming and tool-call delta events to protocol events.
- [x] Bridge loop tool lifecycle/progress events to protocol events.

- [x] Support different request shapes for normal turns and compaction.

## ToolRegistry / ToolExecutor

- [x] Finish builtin tool initialization in `AgentRuntime`; task/file/web tools are initialized there now, remaining old-Agent-bound tools are tracked in `TODO2.md`.
- [x] Implement user tool registration, records, and RPC execution outside `IToolRegistry`.
- [x] Implement MCP tool registration, status watching, auth tools, collisions, and qualified names outside `IToolRegistry`.
- [x] Track active tools and profile gating outside `IToolRegistry`.
- [x] Emit tool list updates.
- [x] Preserve tool source and tool info metadata.
- [x] Implement tool store behavior in `ToolStoreService`.
- [x] Support `resolveExecution`, approval rules, displays, and synthetic results.

## PlanMode

/**
 * `workflow` domain (L6) — `IAgentWorkflowReviewService` contract (Agent
 * scope).
 *
 * Owns the product review of `Workflow` tool calls: running a workflow script
 * means executing arbitrary (user-authored) JS that fans out subagents, so
 * every call in `manual` permission mode goes through an explicit approval
 * round-trip. Under `yolo` / `auto` the permission policy already approves the
 * call, so the review lets it proceed without asking. This is a product
 * review, not a permission: it intercepts the tool with a cold `waitUntil`
 * factory and drives the shared `IAgentToolApprovalService` round-trip,
 * mirroring the plan-mode `ExitPlanMode` review. Marker interface — the
 * service's contribution is the `onBeforeExecuteTool` listener it registers
 * on construction. Bound at Agent scope.

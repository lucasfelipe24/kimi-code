/**
 * `workflow` domain (L6) — `IWorkflowCatalogService` contract (App scope).
 *
 * The process-wide catalog of discovered Dynamic Workflows: resolves the
 * `workflows/` roots (project brand → project generic → user brand → user
 * generic → extra), scans them through the engine-agnostic discovery, and
 * keeps the first-wins merged listing — with the embedded builtin workflows
 * merged last — plus the skipped-file diagnostics. Project roots resolve from the bootstrap `cwd` (the same
 * single-workspace assumption v1's per-session registry made for the CLI);
 * per-session workspace catalogs are future work. Bound at App scope.
